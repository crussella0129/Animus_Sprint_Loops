# Completed Tasks Log (Append-Only)

## T-001 (sprint 0)
- **Description:** Add "build not started" disambiguator to `current-phase.sh` so a finalized-plan sprint with no queued tasks reports `build` instead of `test`.
- **Completed:** 2026-05-19T21:55:00Z
- **Files modified:** `open-harnesses/scripts/current-phase.sh`
- **Commit:** `94f41eb`

## T-002 (sprint 0)
- **Description:** Add `scripts/selftest.sh` that drives every phase transition and asserts `current-phase.sh` output at each step. First run caught a bug in the test's own `sed` pattern (line failed to match the `**Exit status:**` markdown formatting); fixed in the same task.
- **Completed:** 2026-05-19T21:57:00Z
- **Files modified:** `open-harnesses/scripts/selftest.sh` (new)
- **Commit:** (set by commit-task.sh below)
